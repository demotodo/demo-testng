# Selenium and TestNG

http://testng.org/doc/selenium.html

- Considering this scenario, the first thing that comes to mind is creating a long test case that goes through all the steps. 
    - This might be a good approach if you are writing a manual test case.

- However, since we are writing an automated test, we want to write our script as `modular` as possible to be able to reuse parts of it in future scenarios.

- define modular tests, and then specify order in XML (any better way?)
